# HSR
This repository implements a numerical framework for analyzing the phase-space dynamics of  the early universe. Specifically, it provides a consistent method for closing the  Hubble Slow-Roll (HSR) hierarchy by enforcing observational constraints from the  scalar spectral index ($n_s$) directly into the flow equations.
